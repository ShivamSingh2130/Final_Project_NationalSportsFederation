# 🏆 National Sports Federation Database Project

This project is part of **Project Phase 1** submitted by **Shivam Singh**. It represents a SQL-based database management system designed for a **National Sports Federation**, managing entities such as players, events, matches, staff, and more.

## 📁 Project File
- `ProjectPhase1_[ShivamSingh]_[NationalSportsFederation].sql`:  
  This SQL file contains the entire database schema including:
  - Database creation
  - Table definitions
  - Primary and foreign key constraints
  - Insert statements with sample data (if included)

## 📌 Objective
To design and implement a structured relational database for a National Sports Federation that can:
- Store and manage information about athletes, coaches, officials, matches, and tournaments.
- Ensure data integrity using constraints.
- Facilitate easy retrieval and management of data using SQL queries.

## 🧱 Database Schema Includes:
- Players
- Coaches
- Events
- Matches
- Venues
- Staff Members
- Registrations
- Performance Stats

## ⚙️ Requirements
- MySQL / MariaDB / any RDBMS that supports standard SQL
- SQL Client like:
  - MySQL Workbench
  - DBeaver
  - phpMyAdmin
  - HeidiSQL

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open your SQL client.
2. Create a new database (if not already defined in the script).
3. Import or execute the SQL file `ProjectPhase1_[ShivamSingh]_[NationalSportsFederation].sql`.
4. Verify tables and relationships.
5. Start executing queries and analyzing the structure.

## 📊 Future Enhancements (Optional Ideas)
- Add user authentication tables for admin access.
- Create stored procedures for automated tasks.
- Design views and triggers for monitoring and reporting.
- Frontend interface using React/Java/Android App.
